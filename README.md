# JS-bare-necessities
A multiple choice quiz dedicated to testing the user on the "Bare Necessities" of JavaScript.
## Description
  Short, six question quiz to test the user on some basic knowledge of JavaScript. I used HTML as the framework of this project, CSS to make it nicer to look at, and JavaScript for all the processes. This application helps as a short refresh for anyone who needs it. It is also great for spotting small details quickly.
