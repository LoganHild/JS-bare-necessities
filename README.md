# JS-bare-necessities
A multiple choice quiz dedicated to testing the user on the "Bare Necessities" of JavaScript.
## Description
  Short, six question quiz to test the user on some basic knowledge of JavaScript. I used HTML as the framework of this project, CSS to make it nicer to look at, and JavaScript for all the processes. This application helps as a short refresh for anyone who needs it. It is also great for spotting small details quickly.

##Usage
  * Click the START button to begin the quiz.
  * Upon clicking, the timer and quiz itself will appear on the screen.
  * Click an option at the bottom of the box to select your answer, be sure to read each one carefully!
  * Upon clicking an option, the rest will no longer be able to be selected.
  * Once an option has been selected the NEXT button will appear.
  * Click the NEXT button to move on to the next question and repeat the steps above.
  * The time left over at the end will be ther user's score so work quickly!
  * Incorrect answers will deduct 5 seconds worth of time from the timer.
  * The game is over when the time runs out, which will result in a score of 0, or if the user has made it through all of the questions.
  * Once the game is over, the user may enter their initials and score to the highscores list. **work in progress**
